## Technical Specifications

### Data Structure Requirements
- Use NetworkX for graph operations
- Support multiple graph layouts (tree, force-directed, hierarchical)
- Enable export to common graph formats (GraphML, JSON)

### Visualization Features
- Interactive node selection and expansion
- Customizable color schemes for status
- Filtering by status, type, or relationship
- Export to PNG/SVG for documentation

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading for large graphs
- Caching of rendered visualizations
- Efficient graph traversal algorithms

## Implementation Details

### Graph Relationships (COMPLETED)
```python
class RelationType(Enum):
    PARENT_CHILD = "parent_child"
    DEPENDS_ON = "depends_on"
    BLOCKS = "blocks"
    RELATED_TO = "related_to"
    DUPLICATES = "duplicates"
    IMPLEMENTS = "implements"
    INCLUDES = "includes"
    PRECEDES = "precedes"
    FOLLOWS = "follows"

class RelationshipStrength(Enum):
    CRITICAL = "critical"
    STRONG = "strong"
    NORMAL = "normal"
    WEAK = "weak"
```

### API Endpoints (Planned)
```python
# Flask/FastAPI routes
GET /api/graph/{project_id}
GET /api/graph/{project_id}/feature/{feature_id}
POST /api/graph/{project_id}/relationship
DELETE /api/graph/{project_id}/relationship/{id}
GET /api/graph/{project_id}/progress
```

## Dependencies
- NetworkX for graph operations
- Matplotlib/Plotly for static visualization
- D3.js or Cytoscape.js for interactive web visualization
- Flask/FastAPI for web API

## Success Criteria
1. Clear visual representation of project structure
2. Interactive exploration of feature relationships
3. Real-time progress tracking
4. Integration with existing git workflow
5. Performance with graphs up to 1000 nodes

## Testing Requirements
1. Unit tests for graph operations (COMPLETED for Task 3.1.2)
2. Integration tests with planning sessions
3. Performance tests with large graphs
4. UI/UX testing for web interface
5. Cross-browser compatibility testing
